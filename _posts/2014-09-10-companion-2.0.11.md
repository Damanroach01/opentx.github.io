OpenTX Companion is now available as version 2.0.11 
Download Companion and use it to retrieve and transfer the latest OpenTX firmware to your radio.
There is no need to update Companion for using the latest firmware version. The previously available Companion 2.0 versions can be used to download and use OpenTX Firmware 2.0.11.

Please note that the Windows version and the Linux RPM versions are released first. OSX and deb packages may be released later on.

The OpenTX team always encourages upgrading to the latest versions, but no security problems have been found in the earlier 2.0.0 - 2.0.8 versions that make it necessary to update unless you encounter a problem marked as solved in the release notes. If you have a radio other than Taranis, you should however skip the 2.0.10 version as it will corrupt servo limits (dividing everything by 10).
