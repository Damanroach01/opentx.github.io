This is the first Lua telemetry screen script. It can be used to add an aditional telemetry screen to any model.

Do like this:

* Download the telemetry screen script from here: [Download Link](http://lua-20.open-tx.org/telem1.lua) 


* Create a folder on the radio microSD card called SCRIPTS (if it does not already exist)

* Create a new subfolder in the SCRIPTS folder. Give the subfolder the same name as the model that will use the script.

* Place the the script file in the folder. The path should read something like this: /SCRIPTS/*modelname*/telem1.lua


That is it. The new telemetry screen should now automatically appear for the model.
