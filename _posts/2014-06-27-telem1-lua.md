This is the first Lua telemetry screen script. If it is installed it will automatically add an aditional telemetry screen to the model it is used in.

Do like this:

* Download the telemetry screen script from here: [Download Link](http://lua-20.open-tx.org/telem1.lua) 


* Create a new folder on the microSD card placed in the SCRIPTS top level folder. The new folder should be named after the model for which the script will be used

* Place the the script file in the folder. The path should ba something like this: /SCRIPTS/«modelname»/telem1.lua


That is it. The new telemetry screen should now automatically appear for the model.
