Flashing utility for the Taranis on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04+ 64bit, not tested on other systems).  
First uninstall the existing dfu-util if your system has an old version. Then download and install, and make sure that in OpenTX Companion's Burn Preferences (OpenTX Companion menu -> Preferences) the dfu-util path is set to "/usr/bin/dfu-util". Dismiss with OK, and you should now be able to flash.
