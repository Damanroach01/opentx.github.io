This is the second Lua telemetry screen example script. It can be used to add an aditional telemetry screen to any model.
OpenTX firmware version 2.0.4 or greater is needed to use the script.
The script will display two timers, the battery value and the height. The height is displayed using a very large font.
You can edit the script yourself to change what information that is displayed.

Do like this:

* Download the telemetry screen script from here: [Download Link](http://lua-20.open-tx.org/telem2.zip) 

* Create a folder on the radio microSD card called SCRIPTS (if it does not already exist)

* Create a new subfolder in the SCRIPTS folder. Give the subfolder the same name as the model that will use the script.

* Place the the script file in the folder. The path should read: /SCRIPTS/*modelname*/telem2.lua

That is it. The new telemetry screen should now automatically appear for the model.
