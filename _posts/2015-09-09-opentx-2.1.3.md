OpenTX Companion and firmware are now available as version 2.1.3.

This release fixes a couple of minor bugs introduced in 2.1.2:

- Timers were not working on AVR boards (original 9X/9XR)
- Automatically played switch sound files were shifted
- UI bug in special functions
- Missing translations in companion

Download and install Companion and use it to retrieve and transfer the latest OpenTX firmware to your radio.
