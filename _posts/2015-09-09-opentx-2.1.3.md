OpenTX Companion and firmware are now available as version 2.1.3.

This release fixes a couple of minor bugs introduced in 2.1.2:

- Timers were not working on AVR boards (original 9X/9XR)
- Automatically played switch sound files were shifted
- UI bug in special functions
- Missing translations in companion

Download and install Companion and use it to retrieve and transfer the latest OpenTX firmware to your radio.

Please note that the Windows version and the Linux RPM versions of Companion are released first. OSX and deb packages may be released later on.
