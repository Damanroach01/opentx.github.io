title: "Just want to express my thanks to all of you guys for the work that you have been religiously doing for the hobby that we all love. I now have a Transmitter that I can use for my several model aircrafts and helicopters that I have collected and flown over the years. I have various transmitters that I can now dispose of. The Taranis Frsky will always be my transmitter of choice. I still have to learn a lot from the simulation that is easily available right in my computer. Regretfully, I am not a computer programmer hence I can only show my appreciation through donation."
