OpenTX Companion and firmware are now available as version 2.0.13.
 
Download and install Companion and use it to retrieve and transfer the latest OpenTX firmware to your radio.

The OpenTX strongly encourages upgrading to this version which fixes a bug in the RTOS we use.

Please note that the Windows version and the Linux RPM versions of Companion are released first. OSX and deb packages may be released later on.
