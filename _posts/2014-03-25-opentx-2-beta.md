We have recently set up a server to provide nightly builds of the OpenTX firmware and companion "next" development branch called 1.99 for now, and as its status is now stable 
enough we're happy to announce the start of a public beta test period that anybody interested can take part in!

All the required info is available on this [openrcforums thread](http://openrcforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=5163). Please carefully read the first posts
as they contain important information to make sure you don't lose any data. 

Feedback can be given on that same thread, or if you encounter something that you can reproduce repeatably and clearly describe you can directly 
open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/opentx/opentx/issues/new).

We will address any discovered issues, and hopefully move closer to release quickly!
