OpenTX Companion and firmware are now available as version 2.1.2.

**PLEASE NOTE** the following important information:

- Check during companion install that it installs itself in the correct directory, usually "Companion 2.1". A bug that will still show up on this update may cause it to install itself in "Companion 2.0", potentially overwriting your 2.0 install.
- FrSky Taranis X9E users are highly advised to upgrade their radio firmware (including bootloader!) to this version or its equivalent when provided by FrSky due to the risk of shutdown upon software error that was present in previous versions.
- Telemetry sensors are no longer continuously detected, it is now necessary to go to the telemetry setup page and manually select the "Discover new sensors" menu item. This prevents creation of non-existing sensors in case of transmission errors, and allows excluding sensors that are received but considered uninteresting.
- A bug was found in the "Throttle source" setting, fixing it might have changed your selection. If your throttle-based timers don't work check this first and set it back to the correct setting if needed.

Download and install Companion and use it to retrieve and transfer the latest OpenTX firmware to your radio.

Please note that the Windows version and the Linux RPM versions of Companion are released first. OSX and deb packages may be released later on.
