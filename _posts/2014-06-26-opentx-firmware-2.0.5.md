OpenTX Firmware is now available as version 2.0.5
Use any Companion 2.0.x to retrieve the new OpenTX Firmware for your radio.

The OpenTX team always encourages upgrading to the latest versions, but no security problems have been found in the earlier 2.0.0 - 2.0.4 versions that make it necessary to update. If you use the USB Joystick feature, it is working again (was broken on 2.0.4).
