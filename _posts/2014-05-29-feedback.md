title: "Few people know the name Tim Berners-Lee and he never made much money off of his contribution to mankind. Few in the developed world exist a day without using and appreciating the tremendous advances he brought with the development of the World Wide Web. 

I hope you appreciate that - while on a different scale (perhaps, only time will tell) your spearheading the same sort of revolution in electronic control. OpenTx 2.0 is clearly a game changer, and I doubt it will take as long for this game to change as was the retirement of the proprietary and isolated communities of AOL, Compuserve, Prodigy and Delphi. 

OpenTX will usher in a new era and we'll witness the retirement of proprietary systems such as Futaba, Mirtronics, Spectrum, and Jeti. 

I'm living in very exciting times for this hobby."
