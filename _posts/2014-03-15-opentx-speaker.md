A long standing request has been voice generation capabilities in Companion. That is however very hard to implement since there are no cross platform voice generation tools available, As a stop gap we have made the OpenTX Speaker program.

OpenTX Speaker is intended for use on Windows Vista and later. The reason is that the voice generation support in Windows XP whas replaced when Vista came out. It may be possible to run OpenTX Speaker on Windows XP, but that has not been tested.

The program does not need any installation. Just unpack and run it. If you generate sound files for the Taranis, they will end up in the folder that you started the program in.
