OpenTX Speaker can be used to produce a complete set of spoken sentences for use in one of the radios with audio capabilities. You can also change the existing sentences and add your own custom sentences.

All supported voice languages in OpenTX are available for editing in the program.

The voice files are generated by Microsoft's TTS functionality. The quality of the produced voice files depends on which voices you have installed. 

OpenTX Speaker is intended for use on Windows Vista and later. The reason is that the voice generation support in Windows XP was replaced by a much improved version when Vista came out. It may be possible to run OpenTX Speaker on Windows XP, but that has not been tested.

The program does not need any installation. Just unpack and run it.
