Bug reports and enhancement ideas are reported in a common database. The posts in the database are referred to as "issues".  
If you you want to contribute a new idea or report a problem, you can add an issue to the database.  
The first step is to check so that the issue does not already exist.   
 
[All Open Issues](https://github.com/opentx/opentx/issues?labels=&milestone=&page=1&state=open)  
[Open Issues in OpenTX](https://github.com/opentx/opentx/issues?labels=Radio+Firmware&page=1&state=open)  
[Open Issues in Companion](https://github.com/opentx/opentx/issues?labels=Companion&page=1&state=open)  

An issue may turn out to be invalid or solved in an upcoming version of OpenTX or Companion.  
The issue is then closed by a OpenTX administrator.  
It is a good idea to also check the closed issues before  you open a new one.  
 
[Closed Issues in OpenTX](https://github.com/opentx/opentx/issues?labels=Radio+Firmware&page=1&state=closed)

When you are sure that your issue is a new one, you can go ahead and add it to the database.
